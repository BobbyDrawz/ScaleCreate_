SCALE CREATE

basically what this is is some sort of tool that generates chromatic scales in a midi file with some sorta python script
could be useful for many things idk

DONT REUPLOAD [you can fork just give me credit]

btw this needs python libraries mido and easygui to work

start by opening cmd.exe in the folder wit ur copy of scalecreate.py
type 'pip install mido easygui' then you type 'python scalecreate.py' and the program should execute!
